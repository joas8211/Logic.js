This project is work in progress.

Poke me or come back later if you are interested.

## Problem
The primary goal of these libs / apps at the current scope is to be educational.

I've seen educational sources use custom-made diagrams and animations of logic gate structures.
They may be quite time-consuming to make, quality can be shitty, aren't interactive or easily replicated by the audience.
There are already some solutions to this, but they are proprietary and/or not free, as far as I know. (Not tested them out yet)
— https://logic.ly
— https://simulator.io

## Solution
The solution I'm working on would be FOSS and much more advanced.

## Here's what I had in mind

— The application(s) would be separated to multiple libraries for maximum benefit to open-source community, games also.

— The library only comes with needed basic components (logic gates) out of the box and supports abstractions (packages), exporting and importing for further needs and maximizing reality.

— For export / import there could be developed a readable markup language.
Initially thought of an assembly like language, but we need something more readable.

— Step-by-step debugging.

That is where the current scope would end, but ideas for next milestone, which are needed to keep in mind, are as follows:

— Porting APIs to C++ to provide more performant execution environment for more complicated simulations.

— Creating compiler for the language for even more performance if someone with no life really wants to program using the previously mentioned language.

# Current state of the project

— Fundamental logic and gates are done. Needs a lot of reality checking.

— Currently working on diagram drawing. A lot of work there.

- Needs to be separated to a new repository to satisfy the modularity goal.

## Help needed

1. Code review (most important)
2. Project management and documentation (I'll still lead)
3. Testing and unit testing
4. Visualization library
5. Editor web application (first real-life implementation)

If you find yourself capable of doing some or all of the above (in order of importance), I'm honored to get a helping hand or a partner.
All comments and ideas are welcome too.
